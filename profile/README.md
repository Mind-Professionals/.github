## Introduction
This organization is dedicated to the software projects that are in development at Mind Professionals. Although at the moment all repositories are private (due to security concerns), we would like to eventually develop some parts of projects that may be open source.

We use many open-source libraries in the development of our in-house products, and therefore we would love to give back to the OSS community at some point in the future.
